<body>
<h2> Who Will Be QB1? </h2>
<p> Rolling into the 2025 season the question is who will be QB1. Will it be redshirt Sophmore CJ Carr, a very talented young guy coming off of an elbow injury, or will it be Senior Steve Angeli who is a senior and has patiently waiited his turn
and when given the oppurtunity thus far he has thrived. This upcoming spring will be interesting to see who will win the QB battle. </p>
<h2> Who Will Replace Al Golden For The DC Spot</h2>
<p>The number one candidate right now is the current defensive backs coach Mike Mickens. He is similar to Freeman in the fact that they are both young and were together at UC. Mickens is also a players coach.
Mickens is also the current pass game cordinator in which he did phenomal this past year. He is also being eyed by other schools to fill their DC spot so most likely Freeman will like to lock him up and keep him in South Bend</P>
<h2>Can They Get Through The First Few Games?</h2>
<p> The schedule for Notre Dame in 2025 is very front loaded facing 2 top 25 teams in the first 2 weeks. They start the year off facing Miami who just barely missed out on the playoffs. 
Additionally Miami just got Georgia transfer Carson Beck. Then Notre Dame host Texas A&M in their home opener. Those first 2 games will prove if Notre Dame is a legit condender or a pretender.
